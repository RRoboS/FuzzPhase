# FuzzWon
Using inspiration from our studies of AC filters in class we created a very high gain fitler to act as a guitar pedal. We mimiced the 'fuzz' effect using a 2 stage BJT amplifier. In FreeCad we designed a proper encloser for the circuit which allows knobs to purdrude which allows us to modulate the gain and volume of the output and toggle from fuzz to no effect.
